**Hi, my name is Marcel Fahle and I develop web applications.**
I started out around 15 years ago, after I saw a friend who built himself 
a website in Microsoft Frontpage 98, which was so damn ugly that I thought 
to myself, 'I can do better. Hell, I have to do better'. I bought my first 
HTML book and started to crank out the wildest, hand-written HTML Code 
powered by fancy Javascript Rollover-Effects for my menus and cool Alert-Boxes.

A short time and some miserable experiments with the Perl Programming Language later,
I discovered Flash 4 and PHP3, pretty much at the same time. I focused most of
my energy over the next 10 or so years almost exclusively on these two technologies.
Besides developing websites for all our neighbors, or for the local german [Kiosk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiosk)
I also built sites for good personal friends of mine, namely [Patric la Funk](http://patriclafunk.com)
and [ATB](http://atb-music.com) (often highly inspired by the early works of [2Advanced](http://2advanced.com)
and David Martin at [Fantasy Interactive](http://f-i.com)), which led to a series of website awards 
and some attention outside of my inner circles. During the same time I teamed up with other personal 
friends of mine, [Eray Basar](http://twitter.com/toshiyori) and [Sebastian Deutsch](http://twitter.com/sippndipp), 
the digital stuntmen at [9elements](http://9elements.com), who I regard as 
some of the most brilliant designers and engineers I've ever met. We still work together on a regular basis.

In 2003 I worked for the first time with [Gedankenwerk](http://gedankenwerk.com), a digital agency
from Essen, Germany, to do my first gig for [Deutsche Telekom](http://telekom.de). Dozens of other collaborative 
projects would follow, mainly for the telecom mothership from Germany but also other clients 
like [BBDO Proximity](http://www.bbdoproximity.de/), [ThyssenKrupp Elevator](http://thyssenkrupp-elevator.de), 
[Nokia](http://nokia.de), just to name a few.

In 2006 I learned for the first time about Ruby and the Ruby on Rails framework, but it wasn't until years
later that it, together with JavaScript, became my daily weapon of choice.

In recent years I added more and more projects from the United States to my Portfolio, most notably
live broadcasting the state of the state address of Delaware's Govenor Jack Markell (in collaboration
with [Film Brothers](http://filmbrothers.com) or the current website of [Thomas and Friends](http://pbskids.org/thomasandfriends)
for [PBS Kids](http://pbskids.org) and [Very Memorable](http://vm.com), a graphic design shop from New York City.

Besides client work I spent also time on personal projects like [1938News](http://1938news.com), a little blog/radio show
which we grew to over 100.000 subscribers in just a few months.
These days most of my time is spent on [Jumblzar](http://jumblzar.com), a market place for moms I co-founded and where
I currently serve as CTO. 

[See some of my works](/portfolio).

Besides spending countless hours in front of the computer, I first and foremost love to travel. I usually stay away 
from cruise ships or fancy resorts and and prefer independent travel, backpacking, hikes and so forth. You can take a peak
of where my way led me so far on [my Flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcelfahle/sets).
I often tend to combine my trips with personal challenges, like sports events and others. So far I ran 2 full marathons 
(Miami and [New York](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-48-b_ciiU)) and hiked to [Mount Everest Base Camp](http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcelfahle/sets/72157625093076181/), with the ultimate goal actually climbing Mount Everest before I turn 45.
