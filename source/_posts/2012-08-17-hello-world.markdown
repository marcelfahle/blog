*The blog is back, yay!* Unfortunately I wasn't able to save the data 
from my last blog, but that doesn't really matter since the subject
will mostly change anyway. It will still be mostly work related 
stuff, but since I shifted away from AS3 programming a while ago, most
of the things you'll find here is Ruby and JavaScript related.

To be more specific, these days I enjoy working with 
[Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/, "Ruby on Rails"), 
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/, "CoffeeScript"), 
[backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/, "Backbone.js") 
and the shell, so expect a lot of that. I'll also put all those things in here, 
I learned in my daily work life and want to remember in the future. 
That could range from highly advanced jedi tricks to absolutely beginner 
one-liners even your mother knows, but somehow I happened to just find out about. 
If I want to remember it, it'll land in here, no matter how trivial it is.

So that paired with a few paragraphs on the projects I'm working on here and there
and some personal things I'm interested in, like filmes and books and stuff,
should lead to a collection of pretty awesome content, don't you think?

Oh, and I'm doing the whole thing now in [Octopress](http://octopress.org/, "Octopress") 
and vim, so bear with me if the look and feel of this blog will change a lot in the first days/weeks.

That being said, thanks a lot for stopping by and I hope you enjoy the ride.
