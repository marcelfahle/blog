I finally added a bunch of projects to [my portfolio](/portfolio) to get you 
a better idea of the work I'm doing.  There will be much more in the near 
future and I'm even thinking about a *Hall of fame* kind of thing, where I show
some really, really old stuff, just for the fun of it (it is actually quite funny!). 
It takes a while to find all those things in my archive though, as I piled up a good 
bunch of projects over the last 16 years. 
I also added a [resume](/resume) (finally!), as I'm actively job hunting right now! So if you,
or anybody you know has a fun freelance gig, shoot me an [email](mailto:m.fahle@gmail.com). Thanks! :-)
